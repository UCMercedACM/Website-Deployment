Website-Deployment
==================

This is the deployment repo for the ACM Website. 

**DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO AND ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH IT!!!**

If you have been given access to push, you will know where to find the working copy of the code.
If you have not been given access to push, but you would like to contribute, clone this repo and then
show your changes to an ACM officer. If they like the idea, they will incorporate it or invite you to
join the editing group.

If you have access to push to this repo: **DO NOT PUSH CHANGES HERE WITHOUT COMMITTING THEM TO THE WORKING
COPY FIRST!!** Else I shall hunt you down with a particularly sharp spoon and a half pint of whiskey.

In case this was not clear from before:

DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO AND WORK ON IT
